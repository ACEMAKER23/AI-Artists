> This project will guide you though fine tuning a diffusor image generation model so that the image generated by the AI will be conistent in style.

## 📖 Description
While foundation models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images, they suffer from stylistic drift and high sensitivity to prompt phrasing. Describing complex visual styles via text alone is often imprecise and non-deterministic.

This project leverages LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to solve this by fine-tuning diffusion models on custom datasets. By training directly on reference images rather than relying on text descriptions, users can 'lock in' a consistent visual identity. This enables the generation of infinite, stylistically coherent game assets that strictly adhere to a specific art direction
